# Modelling the ecosystem of Rossum√∏ya
This project is a development of a population dynamic
simulation. 
The development team consists of two NMBU students; Nina Mariann Vesseltun
 and Trude Haug Almestrand. The simulation consists of a series of biomes
 , respectively desert, savannahs, mountains, ocean and jungle with two
  types of
  animals: herbivores and carnivores.
  
 ## How biomes work
 The biomes are tilebased with ocean covering the top and bottom, and sides
  of the map so that it simulates an island. There are two impassable biome
   tiles: ocean and mountain. Meaning that herbivores and carnivores can not
    enter these tiles. They are restricted to only entering savannahs
    , deserts and jungle. Savannahs has limited fodder whereas jungle is
     fast growing and has "unlimited" fodder. Savannahs replenish their
      fodder slowly (over several years depending on the number of
       individual herbivores) whilst
       jungle replenishes theirs to max after one year.
    
 ## The animals
 Herbivores graze on savannahs and jungle at a given value F. If there are
  multiple individuals grazing the resources can deplete. Weight is gained
   based off of how much they eat and fitness is ....
   
   Carnivores ....
